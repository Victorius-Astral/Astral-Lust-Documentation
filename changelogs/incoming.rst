Undefined
---------

I have no idea when these changes will come live.
They are not planned, I'll be implementing them after doing planned content for given version.
So the speed of their implementation depends on my speed of making planned content.

* give your own dialogue choices when speaking with vanilla characters and using items
* Adding your own pc apps
* adding your own choices to the lobby doors (make new expansions, new outside content)
* using your own screens in rooms (add interactable items, people)
* add new enemy actions tags (if you need more than 6 images per enemy)
* add new girls to the wardrobe

Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't know if they ever make it to the game, these are some of the better suggestions, fell free to implement them in your mod:

* upgrade playroom into a harem, so that succubi are not kept in the cold, dark dungeon
* card fusion - Where you can fuse say five of the same type(attack, power etc.) and rarity of card and receive a random card from the next level of rarity of the same type. Either in forge or new Alchemy room.
* A thief girl you random encounter that steals one of your cards. If you have enough agility ~5-7 you can catch her and get a lil bj scene. If you cant catch here the card ist lost
* hypnotize the girls into a trance and having sex with them, or coming across female rouges and after beating them hypnotizing them to be placed into the dungeon all kind of stuff.
* it would be nice to be able to buy the trader's daughter and take her to the hotel.
* once an achievements system is in place, make it so the back of the cards is customizable. As in, you can unlock what to see instead of just the current default (the one with the kabbalah tree of life)

Working, but not in the docs
----------------------------

These things can be already done without altering vanilla game files and hurting compatibility.
The thing is these things aren't described in the documentation yet.

* Adding your own collectibles
* Displaying help screen with your own custom messages
* Adding your own cheat codes
* Adding and tweaking character states
* Adding your own outfits to the girls and the wardrobe
* Adding enemy flags, using alternative action methods, using ultimate abilities after reaching some hp (see dragon)
* Adding your scenes to replay gallery
* Adding new prostitutes to the wanderers' hideout brothel
