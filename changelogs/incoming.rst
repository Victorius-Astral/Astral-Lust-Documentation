Incoming Changes and Features, Players' Suggestions for Mod Features
====================================================================

This is designed for modders.
It describes planned changes to the way AL works so that you can prepare your mod or start working on new features.
It also describes what modding support I want to implement.

Next version

These things are planned for the next alpha release.

* Store cards at the forge
* Sorting deck

Undefined
---------

I have no idea when these changes will come live.
They are not planned, I'll be implementing them after doing planned content for given version.
So the speed of their implementation depends on my speed of making planned content.

* give your own dialogue choices when speaking with vanilla characters and using items
* Adding your own pc apps
* adding your own choices to the lobby doors (make new expansions, new outside content)
* using your own screens in rooms (add interactable items, people)
* add new enemy actions tags (if you need more than 6 images per enemy)
* add new girls to the wardrobe

|

Planned features (feel free to implement these stuff in your mods, who knows when these will be in the game):

* artifacts
* characteristics (abilities and traits, something like a class)
* card upgrades
* card memory (keep cards after death, select unique cards to be in the deck)
* factions - relationships, bases, quests
* strip club expansion
* bar expansion
* currency creation
* advanced economics system
* card trading
* rework of GUI
* new gallery screen, with images
* two more succubi
* catching pets
* battle aid by pets and girls
* second and third hotel floor
* advanced enemies' AI
* support for many enemies in combat
* drag/drop cards in battle
* dungeons, classical reguelite deckbuilder experience
* outpost creation and management (hub for other factions, lead a force of your own)
* faction creation
* SFW mode
* translations
* android version

|

Suggestions (I don't know if they ever make it to the game, these are some of the better suggestions, fell free to implement them in your mod):

* upgrade playroom into a harem, so that succubi are not kept in the cold, dark dungeon
* card fusion - Where you can fuse say five of the same type(attack, power etc.) and rarity of card and receive a random card from the next level of rarity of the same type. Either in forge or new Alchemy room.

Working, but not in the docs
----------------------------

These things can be already done without altering vanilla game files and hurting compatibility.
The thing is these things aren't described in the documentation yet.

* Adding your own collectibles
* Adding your own wallpapers
* Displaying help screen with your own custom messages
* Adding your own cheat codes
* Adding and tweaking character states
* Adding your own outfits to the girls and the wardrobe
* Adding enemy flags, using alternative action methods, using ultimate abilities after reaching some hp (see dragon)
